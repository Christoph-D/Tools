These are just some tools or snippets I wrote for some very specific
purposes.

This repository currently contains the following scripts:
* stretch_video
  Usage: stretch_video factor filename

  Changes the speed of the video by the given factor. It uses
  soundstretch to resample the sound track of the source file. All
  other tracks are copied directly and only resynced to the new audio,
  so the frame rate of video tracks will increase/decrease
  accordingly. Subtitle tracks are resynced as well.

  Due to using soundstretch, the quality is somewhat better than with
  mplayer -af scaletempo.

  This script accepts most container formats and all audio formats
  ffmpeg can handle. Tested with mkv, mp4, flv and QuickTime. The
  result will always be a Matroska file (mkv) with ogg vorbis audio.
